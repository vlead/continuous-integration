* Purpose of Continuous Integration
  - Currently a lab is defined as a set of related experiments and is
    a web application.
  - Each lab is a repository on github.
  - To ensure evolution of software and solicit contribution from
    folks across the world, continuous integration will be used around
    each lab.
  - This continuous integration tool automates the building, testing
    and deploying of lab/service on varioius platforms.
  - Projects created by a single individual or entire teams can use
    this service to automate the integration process. 
  - A cycle for integration  will involve building the code, running the unit test cases, hosting the
    application and running the integration tests. 
  - Each integration is verified by an automated build (including
    test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. 
  - Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced
    integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive
    software more rapidly.
